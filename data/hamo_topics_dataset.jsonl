{"text": "Right. So you don't think you're abusive. You've received a criticism, you've had a look at yourself, and that's the conclusion you've reached. What do you think is wrong with you, that you would not be able to go through that process and reach an acceptable conclusion? I think the crux here lies in what you said at the end of your post: 'Maybe I am the problem?' There isn't just one problem here. You ARE the problem, for him. You, being yourself, is an issue for him. But that doesn't mean that you are problematic as an individual. I might have a problem with the colour of your shirt, but that doesn't mean you've got the 'choosing a shirt' part of today 'wrong'. Does that make sense? You get a say in this. You get to choose whether your actions are a problem for *you* or not. You feel a particular way about your actions, and your feelings are facts. For you, that IS how things are. If he wants to see you as a problem, that's up to him. It doesn't mean you are one. A question: Does anybody else who knows you see you as problematic? It's pretty common in abuse situations, particularly with a narcissistic partner, for everybody else other than possibly a parent, to see the victim as a lovely, sweet, kind, compassionate person, someone they can take their problems to and be treated empathically; a safe space. Only the abuser seems to think that the person is a problem, and it's a BIG problem, that's causing ALL the issues and RUINING everything.

Hi guys, How to know if my wife is a narcissist? - She cheated on me for 8/10 years of our relationship. - She constantly blames me for her cheating, anger, toxic behavior, ruining her life, not giving her what she deserves. - She belittles me in front of my in laws. - She has been physically and verbally abusive towards me for the most part of our relationship but also blaming me for the actions and blaming me for ruining her life. - She does not show empathy even after I found out her cheating. She doesn‚Äôt care what I‚Äôm going through. - She said sorry for minimal stuff in our relationship but as far as I remember her sorry has no weight. I feel she does not mean that. - I can never have an emotional and logical conversation with her, it mostly ends up in fight and saying how wrong I am and how much I don‚Äôt understand her. - She can‚Äôt hear no for an answer. Whatever she says we have to do otherwise she will get angry and starts abusive behavior. If I tell her no we shouldn‚Äôt buy that, or no she can‚Äôt go travel alone, no don‚Äôt talk to that guy she cheated me with, no don‚Äôt meet the members who supported the cheating and that all results in her getting angry. - she says she will never go for a therapy otherwise I will check with the therapist and get her to do a check/test on her based on her individual session but that‚Äôs not an answer.

They are in their formative years; what you are doing now will be what they do in their adult relationships. It will be what feels like home to them. Don't say that you don't argue in front of them so they don't know what's going on: I was the 5 year old, I remember it well. Your safest bet is to validate your partner's feelings. I know it sounds counterintuitive, but bear in mind that *he's as mad as a box of frogs*. You know when someone has dementia and the best thig to do is just go along with them? Do that. You can say 'I understand why you feel that way', and 'Thank you for sharing that with me', and 'Yes, I hear what you're saying' and 'I see your perspective', and simultaneously think he's being a complete arsehole. Show your kids that creating civil distance between your own emotional world and that of an abuser is the healthy way forward. Daddy can stand there calling you an arsehole, and you don't have to prove to anybody that you're not. 'OK, I understand your feelings.' lifts you high above any debate, which is fantastic, because there *is* no debate about who you are or what your feelings are.", "labels": ["communication_breakdown", "parenting_conflicts"], "primary_label": "communication_breakdown", "label_scores": {"parenting_conflicts": 1, "communication_breakdown": 1}, "kind": "comment", "source_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticSpouses/comments/1ohwctx/is_this_another_narcissistic_move/nlten6k/"}

{"text": "It's the same as the reason you stayed, even though he was horrible. The truth is too hard. YES IT GETS EASIER. (I feel like that warranted capitals, because it's really really important for you to know, right now) You may not be able to picture this, but once you've recovered a bit, your brain will stop focussing on the 'terrible loss' of the good parts and hope. It will start to look at the bits it has *never* wanted to have to process. That feeling you have that you will always love him will change, as your internal systems gradually piece together the confusing relationship you just had. He will look worse and worse until the thought of him makes you go 'Ew!' But the important thing to note is that this is something that will happen to you naturally, rather than something you 'do', and that takes the pressure off the idea that you 'should' feel better by now, or 'why am I still struggling with this?' It's like waiting for a broken leg to heal; it's frustrating, you want it to be better NOW, but all you can do is nurture it and allow it to heal at its own pace. So, you are now very much in a place where you need to nurture yourself. 'Why the fuck does my brain want to do this?!' is a punishing attitude and will slow your healing. All your questions about what's happening within you have a perfectly logical answer, and all of it makes sense. You are thinking about the good times because when we lose something, it is natural to think about it. You feel like you are dying because of the depth of your injury (not just the break up but the relationship itself) Saying goodbye is hard because there is more than one side of him, because you've been attached, because you have to let go of hope.

{"text": "A few things to think about. What you are describing is malignant narcissist behavior. This is how they emotionally punish someone. Malignant narcissistic behaviors include targeted and intensified attacks during vulnerable times‚Äîpregnancy. This is sociopathic, in order for you to protect yourself and pregnancy, distance or exit is the only way. He is ill and no amount of rationale or moral responsibility will ever change this.

Emotional distress during pregnancy isn‚Äôt just dangerous for you but the life you carry and support. Postpartum depression is a risk in the best of circumstances, what do you think happens when you add a narcissist into the mix, it can be disastrous. How did you feel while in the relationship?

{"text": "I had a dream about my NEX last night and I feel weird about it I woke up this morning from a dream about my NEX-wife. We have been separated for over two and a half years and are in the process of getting divorced. I have also been in a happy and healthy relationship with my new partner for more than two years. She was also in a relationship with a narcissist for many years. In my dream, I visited her in a psychiatric ward, but from the outside it looked more like a hotel in Las Vegas (last night I was thinking about a trip we took 12 years ago that started in Las Vegas, so that's probably where that came from). I waited alone in her room, then she came in and wanted to hug/kiss me. I told her that I didn't want to and that I had a new partner. She then snapped and asked if I had a child with her. I said no (I have a wonderful eight-year-old stepson, but I won't be able to have any children of my own). She then told me to leave, I said that was probably for the best and left. I remember feeling kind of sorry and guilty for her. Then I woke up. My partner was already awake, so I took her hand and told her about the dream. This situation with wanting to hug/kiss against my will happened a few times shortly after the breakup. Nevertheless, the dream left me with a very strange, unpleasant feeling.

However, I don't know any details about it, as I only have a little information from a friend to whom she described her side of the story.
