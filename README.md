This is all about Sentiment Analysis and Trigger Detection.
Human communication is sometimes dominated by cognitive illusions and emotions. People suffer greatly as a result.
Our mission is to develop family sentiment models and solutions to help people heal and grow within their family relationships.
Sentiment Detection, Empathetic Companionship, and Response Generation are the three key functions to address these challenges.
