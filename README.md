觉知发生的一切
沟通中的认知和情绪，塑造了我们的人格与关系
Be aware of everything that happens
The way we think and feel in communication shapes who we are and how we connect with others

This is all about Sentiment Analysis and Trigger Detection.
Human communication is sometimes dominated by cognitive illusions and emotions. People suffer greatly as a result.
Our mission is to develop family sentiment models and solutions to help people heal and grow within their family relationships.
Sentiment Detection, Empathetic Companionship, and Response Generation are the three key functions to address these challenges.
